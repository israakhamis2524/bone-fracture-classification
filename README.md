# 🦴 Bone Fracture Classification Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify X-ray images of bone fractures into two main types:
- **Comminuted Bone Fracture**
- **Simple Bone Fracture**

A pre-trained **MobileNetV2** model is used with a **Streamlit** interface to make predictions in real-time.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from **Kaggle** and contains X-ray images categorized as:
- `Comminuted Bone Fracture`
- `Simple Bone Fracture`

The data was augmented and split into:
- Train
- Validation
- Test
